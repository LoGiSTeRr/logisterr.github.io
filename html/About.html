                    Did you know that New York was, at first,
                    not New York at all? The original name was
                    New Amsterdam as Dutch settlers were the
                    first to arrive in the area around 1624.
                    But in 1664, the English took over and
                    renamed the city in the Duke of York’s honor.

                    famous Grand Central Terminal, there is an unbelievable architectural marvel at play.
                    If one person stands in one corner of the tiled wall and another stands on the opposite side,
                    they can whisper to each other. And the other person will be able to hear!
